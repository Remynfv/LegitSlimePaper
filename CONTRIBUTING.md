# How to contribute to LegitSlimePaper

## Found a bug?
- If it's a security vulnerability or a dangerous exploit, **do not share it publicly in an issue!** Instead, create a new Ticket in the discord: [#support](https://discord.gg/PTW4JxZDPM) (also ping @legitimoose, depending on the severity of the exploit).
- Ensure the issue has not already been reported by searching for it.
- When creating a new issue, make sure the title is concise and straight to the point and the description is detailed (how to replicate, expected behaviour, possible fix, etc.).

## You made a patch that fixed a bug?
- If it's a security vulnerability or a dangerous exploit, **do not share it publicly in a Pull Request!** Instead, create a new Ticket in the discord: [#support](https://discord.gg/PTW4JxZDPM) (also ping @legitimoose, depending on the severity of the bug).
- Make sure that there is not already a Pull Request ("PR") patching the same bug. If the solution in another PR is "bad", comment on it, explaining how to improve it instead of making a whole new PR. If the "bad" PR has already been merged, you can make a new one to improve it though.

## A new feature?
- If you have not coded the feature, suggest it in the Discord: [#features-and-bugs](https://discord.gg/TQxmwd69Ub).
- If you _have_ coded the feature, make a pull request for it, describing why you chose to add this feature. (Make sure it has not been PR'ed before though).

## Any other questions?
Ask in the legitimoose Discord Server! (Use any of the links above.)


Thanks! 💚
